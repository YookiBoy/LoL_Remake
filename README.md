# LoL_Remake
My project was to make a "Remake" of LoL 10.16 Patch Notes site (https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/patch-10-16-notes/) and make it in 3 different styles, then compare the UI/UX with the students in the class, and get feedback from them. Now I'm posting it here to see your feedback.  

Feedback : I showed my websites to V**** and W**** and they said "the first one was perfect but I should have a fade on that banner image. The other one thought I could change the colors of  and could make the first list a little better. The last one told them that the background color was bad it did not match pictures and the borders were too bold they could be less than 1px" 

Feedback from Teacher : "I am missing a text file from the last part in part: 3 where you have to write down what you came up with when you asked your classmate about the different styles. If you fix it, you get an A rating for this task." [I fixed it and I got an A :) ]
